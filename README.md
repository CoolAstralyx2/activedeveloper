Hello my friend! Small guide about how to use it.
1. Install zip.
2. When you installed it, put the folder somewhere.
3. Open the folder, and open config.json
4. Find the **"token": "I don't remember what token inside"**, so basically you need to put the token of your Discord bot in double quotes. And then save the config.
5. Now, open the start_bot.bat, it need to take some time to load. And when it will be ready, then you should get this text "BotName.ready"
6. When it ready, open the discord server with your bot, and type the command /ping, and he will answer you with "pong"
Done!
